# Japanese Pear Production Structure Analysis

This project analyzes long-term changes in Japanese pear production
by examining regional production structures using publicly available
agricultural statistics.

Rather than focusing on short-term yield fluctuations, the analysis
emphasizes structural differences across prefectures and how these
structures have evolved over time.

## Data
The analysis is based on official statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture,
Forestry and Fisheries of Japan. Raw data are not redistributed.

## Methods
- Python-based data preprocessing and visualization
- Structural comparison using cultivated area and yield per unit area
- Rule-based classification of production types
- Long-term comparison between 2003 and 2024

## Notebooks
- `01_data_overview.ipynb`
- `02_production_structure_eda.ipynb`
- `03_long_term_comparison.ipynb`

## Key Findings
(TBD)

## Limitations
